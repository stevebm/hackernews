This site was made as a simple way to try uusing django
The database integration has been disabled for this demo although the models are still used in the same manner that they would be if there was a database.
At the moment, everytime someone visits index the server will do requests to api.hackernews.com
    - one to get the latest articles
    - one to get the latest comments
An improvement would be to cache these replies and setup a scheduled taks to poll hackernews periodically and store the results in a database. This woudl geratly improve the page laod speed and scalability of the site.
